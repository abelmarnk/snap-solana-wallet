   * A callback that will be called:
   * - when the connection is opened (in case subscription was requested before it was opened).
   * - when the connection is re-opened after it was lost.
   *
   * This is the "message gap recovery", that allows us to compensate for potential missed messages.
   * When a connection is lost unexpectedly, any messages we miss while disconnected can result in the UI falling behind or becoming corrupt.
   * This callback should typically contain an HTTP fetch to catch-up with the latest state.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Connection is open...
   *
   * const subscriber = new SubscriberAdapter(...);
   * await subscriber.subscribe({method: "accountSubscribe", ...}, {
   *   onConnectionRecovery: async () => {
   *     // Fetch the latest account state from the server.
   *     const account = await fetchAccount(accountAddress);
   *     // Update the state
   *   },
   * });
   *
   * // Connection is lost...
   * // Some changes happen on the account, that are missed while disconnected.
   * // Connection is re-opened...
   * // The onConnectionRecovery is called, ensuring we update the state with the latest account state.
   * // Subscription is re-established, and we receive again the future changes.
   * ```
